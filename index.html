				<h2>Welcome to Birdwood Nursery.</h2>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Birdwood Nursery is a long established pre school setting for children aged 2&frac12; to 4&frac12; years.  Its objective is to provide a safe, happy environment where children can play and learn, developing their own personality and skills at their own pace, according to their own potential.</p>
				<p>
					In October 2022 Birdwood Nursery was rated Outstanding by Ofsted.  You can read their report <a href="documents/EYR-Inspection-Report-EIF.pdf" target="about:blank">here</a>.  The inspector found that:
					<blockquote>Children access a setting that truly excites and encourages their thirst for learning</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						The manager and deputy have a clear vision and ethos of what they want children to learn and why.
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>Staff know children incredibly well</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						Staff provide a language-rich environment and are consistent in ensuring that all children hear
						and develop a rich vocabulary.
					</blockquote>
